# demo-boilerplate

Node boilerplate for demos/pocs loosely based on [Jack Franklin's](https://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin) Express boilerplate [found here](https://github.com/jackfranklin/express-server-boilerplate).

It's stripped down, only really for one/two page demos/apps, to get up and running quickly.
